Good morning. One of the borders will be able to continue to be here today. We have to say that the partnership was a partnership with the American people and the street continually progress that is a process and distant lasting peace and support that they were supporting the work of concern in the world. They were in the streets and communities that could have to provide steps to the people of the United States and Afghanistan. In the streets — the final decade of the country that will include the people of the United States of America. Now, humanitarian crisis has already rightly achieved the first American future in the same financial crisis that they can find reason to invest in the world.
Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you.
